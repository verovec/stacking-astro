// The three Milky Way numbers the viewer needs for itself.

// This is a PINNED MIRROR, not a model. The Galaxy's structure — the Reid et al. 2019 arm loci, the
// disc and thick-disc profiles, the boxy bulge and long bar, the halo's broken power law, and the
// blackbody colour of each population — lives in `internal/scene3d/galaxymodel.go` and reaches the
// browser as a sampled point cloud (see `galaxycloud.ts`). Nothing here recomputes any of it.
//
// What is left is geometry the camera needs: where the Sun stands, how high above the plane, and how
// big the drawn disc is, so the journey can frame it and the reference rings can be drawn around it.
// `galaxy.spec.ts` pins these against the Go constants — one canonical source, one mirror, and a
// test that fails if they drift.
