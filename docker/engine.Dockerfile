# Containerized AstroStack engine (`astrostack serve`: HTTP API + worker) with the Linux builds of the
# tools it drives baked in — Siril, GIMP, GraXpert, ffmpeg. This is the portable / server-deploy path;
# daily macOS dev still uses the host-run engine (the "host-engine exception" in CLAUDE.md). No Go code
# changes: every tool path is a config env var, set to the Linux install below.

# The VLM (finish supervisor) is NOT in this image — it's a separate, opt-in OpenAI-compatible server
# the engine reaches over ASTRO_LLM_URL (native mlx on macOS, or the `ai` compose service on Linux+GPU).

# --- Siril: installed to match the image architecture, so the engine runs NATIVELY on the host arch
# (amd64 on a Linux server, arm64 on Apple Silicon) — no emulation.
#   • amd64 → the host's 1.4.x x86_64 AppImage, extracted (best output parity; Siril ships only x86_64).
#   • arm64 → the maintainer PPA (ppa:lock042/siril) 1.4.x build. Siril ships no arm64 AppImage, and the
#     distro 'universe' package is only 1.2.1 — too old for the 1.4 script syntax the pipeline emits
#     (e.g. `rgbcomp -lum=/-out=`), which 1.2.x silently ignores, breaking the finish. See README
#     "version-drift". Override the amd64 URL / arm64 PPA with --build-arg to track the host exactly.

# StarNet++ is deliberately NOT baked in (its licence isn't redistributable). Two ways to enable star
# removal, and which one applies is decided by ARCHITECTURE, not preference:
#   • linux/amd64 image → bind-mount your Linux x64 StarNet install and set STARNET_BIN. A resolvable
#     local binary always wins over the host service below.
#   • linux/arm64 image (any Apple-Silicon build) → there is NO StarNet to mount: upstream publishes
#     Linux x64, Windows x64 and both macOS builds, but no linux/arm64 one, and a macOS binary
#     bind-mounted here is a Mach-O that Linux will never exec. Run the host service instead
#     (`just run-starnet-service`) — ASTRO_STARNET_URL already points at it under `just stack`.
# Until one of those is in place the pipeline keeps full stars (no star reduction AND no star-presence
# set — the tier PNGs are simply not written).
