// color.go holds the one-shot-color seams of the deep-sky pipeline.
//
// The design decision worth stating once: a colour run is NOT a second pipeline. It is the ordinary
// per-channel pipeline with exactly one channel, named RGB (inspect.nameColorChannel stamps it), so
// calibration against the master library, frame grading, trail masking, set QA, dither diagnostics,
// plate-solving, SPCC, GraXpert, StarNet, denoise, star-quality auto-fix, the supervised finish,
// stage previews, per-stage rerun and the S3 paths all apply to colour without being reimplemented.
// Only three things genuinely differ, and each is one small seam here:
//
//  1. INGEST — a raw CFA mosaic must reach Siril still undebayered, so calibration can divide the
//     flat and repair defects in CFA space and demosaic afterwards (colorIngest / CalibMasters.CFA).
//     Debayering first smears every hot pixel across its neighbours.
//  2. COMBINE — there is nothing to combine. The stacked master is already RGB, so the LRGB
//     rgbcomp step is skipped and the master goes straight to the finish (isColorRun).
//  3. PALETTE — the palettes map FILTERS onto output channels, which is meaningless here, so a
//     colour run resolves to a fixed pass-through palette with no emission screens (colorPalette).
