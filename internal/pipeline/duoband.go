// duoband.go lets a ONE-SHOT-COLOUR duo-band capture reach the narrowband palettes.
//
// A dual-band filter (L-eXtreme, L-Ultimate and friends) in front of a Bayer sensor already performs
// the separation a filter wheel gives the mono path: Hα at 656 nm lands on the RED pixels, [OIII] at
// 500.7 nm on the GREEN and BLUE ones. The physical information is there — it just arrives as three
// planes of one exposure instead of three exposures. The palette engine could not see it, because
// resolvePalette short-circuits every colour run to a pass-through (paletteSpecs is written in
// filter names a colour sensor does not have), so the Hubble-style renditions this data is actually
// shot for were unreachable and it could only ever be finished as muddy broadband RGB.
//
// Splitting the stacked master into pseudo-Hα and pseudo-[OIII] channel files puts the run back on
// the ordinary narrowband road: hoo/foraxx resolve, rgbcomp composes them, and Foraxx's GExpr pixel
// math works unchanged.
//
// [OIII] is the per-pixel MAXIMUM of green and blue, not their mean. The 500.7 nm line sits on the
// shoulder between the two Bayer passbands, so each catches a different fraction of it; averaging
// folds the weaker one into the signal and costs SNR exactly where the [OIII] is faintest, while the
// maximum keeps whichever pixel actually caught the line. Nothing is invented — both planes are
// measurements of the same line.
//
// Only Hα and [OIII] are synthesized. A duo-band filter passes no [SII], so "sho" cannot be honoured
// from this data and is left to the palette engine's own fallback chain (→ hoo, with its note). The
// Hubble-like rendition available here is "foraxx", whose dynamic green is the geometric mean of the
// two real lines.
