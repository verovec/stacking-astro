// Package sim is a complete simulated observatory: a camera, a filter wheel and a mount that behave
// like the real thing, sharing one simulated telescope state.
//
// It is not a stub. It renders REAL star fields from the bundled catalogue at whatever the simulated
// mount is pointing at, with seeing, defocus, sky glow, read noise and periodic error — so the focus
// meter, the plate-solve centring loop, the dither feedback and the whole capture sequencer can be
// developed and regression-tested end to end with no hardware attached. It also stays useful after
// the hardware arrives: it is the demo mode, and the only way to reproduce a night on demand.
