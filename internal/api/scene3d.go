// 3D field-map endpoint: serves the scene internal/scene3d builds from a run's star annotation —
// every detected star placed at its own distance, plus the catalogued objects in the field hung at
// theirs. The scene is NOT computed here: it is built as part of the star annotation
// (computeStars), because it needs exactly the detections, identifications and validated geometry
// that pass already produced. One detection pass, two artifacts, no way for them to disagree.
//
// Like stars.json the manifest stays local-only — a cheap derived cache. The heavy parts
// (scene3d.bin, scene3d_bg.png) are ordinary run files and go out through GET /api/file, which
// already handles the S3 pull-through for a run whose local copy was freed.
