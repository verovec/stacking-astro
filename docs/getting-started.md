# Getting started

From a fresh clone to your first stacked image. Written for someone who has never seen this project
— if a step assumes something you do not have, it says so.

If you only want the short version, the [README quickstart](../README.md#quickstart) is the same
path without the explanations.

---

## 1. Choose how you will run it

There are two ways, and they are genuinely different.

| | **Container mode** (`just stack`) | **Host mode** |
|---|---|---|
| What runs where | Everything in Docker, with Linux Siril/GIMP/GraXpert baked into the image | The Go engine runs on your Mac and drives your own Siril/GIMP; Docker provides Postgres only |
| You must install | Docker and `just`, nothing else | Go, Node/pnpm, Siril, ffmpeg (+ optionally GIMP) |
| Setting up | One command, and it sets itself up | A handful of Homebrew installs, then `just setup` |
| Best for | **Your first run**, Linux, a server, or "just make it run" | Daily development on a Mac — faster to iterate, and it is what the Go tests exercise |
| Ports | API 8080, UI 8082 | API 8080, UI 5173 |

Siril and GIMP are desktop applications that cannot run in a Linux container on macOS, which is why
host mode exists at all. It is a deliberate exception to this project's otherwise
everything-in-Docker rule — see
[architecture.md](architecture.md#deliberate-deviation).

**Container mode is one command.** If that is what you want:

```bash
just stack
```

It creates `.env` and the data directories, checks that Docker is running and the ports are free,
builds the images, waits for the engine, prints which tools it found and what degrades without each
one, and ends with the URL. Re-run it whenever — it is idempotent and reports only what it changed.

The first build takes **15–40 minutes** and produces a multi-GB image, because it bakes in Linux
Siril, GIMP, GraXpert and ffmpeg. Later runs reuse it.

Then open the URL it prints (<http://localhost:8082> by default) and skip to
[§5](#5-your-first-run).

The rest of this page covers host mode.

## 2. Install the prerequisites

```bash
just --version        # if this fails, install just first: https://github.com/casey/just
docker info           # must print a server section — Docker Desktop has to be RUNNING
go version            # 1.23 or newer
node --version        # 22 or newer (the frontend image builds on node:22)
pnpm --version        # `corepack enable` if missing
```

Then the astronomy tools:

```bash
brew install --cask siril     # required — it does the stacking
brew install ffmpeg           # required for video output and the demo/screenshot tools
brew install --cask gimp      # recommended — it does the layered finish
brew install libraw           # recommended — develops DSLR/phone raw files
```

Then ask the engine what it can actually see:

```bash
just doctor           # every external tool, grouped by what its absence costs
```

It groups them as **Required** (Siril, ffmpeg, Postgres — nothing runs without these),
**Recommended** (GIMP, a raw developer), **Optional** (GraXpert, StarNet++, a local vision
model) and the plate-solving catalogues, then lists a plain-language warning for
anything missing. `just stack` prints the same report from inside the container, so the two modes
can be compared line for line.

Things worth knowing before you hit them:

- **`just setup` is macOS-flavoured.** It installs `golangci-lint` with Homebrew and assumes `pnpm`
  is already on your PATH. On Linux, install both yourself and skip `just setup`.
- **Siril is not checked at startup.** The engine starts fine without it and prints one warning to
  stderr; the failure shows up when your first job runs. `just doctor` is the check that is not
  easy to miss. If you installed Siril somewhere other than `/Applications/Siril.app`, set
  `SIRIL_BIN` in `.env`.
- **GIMP is optional but visible.** Without it the finish falls back to Siril's simpler
  composition — the run succeeds, the picture is just less good.

Optional extras, all soft-fail (missing → a warning and a fallback, never a failed run):
[GraXpert](https://www.graxpert.com) for AI gradient removal and denoise,
[StarNet++ v2](https://www.starnetastro.com) for star reduction, and a local vision model for the
[finish supervisor](agent.md).

---

## 3. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

`.env.example` is heavily commented; you can run with it unchanged. The one setting worth looking at
now is where your captures live:

```bash
ASTRO_DATA_DIR=./input      # the only folder the web UI may browse
```

**None of the data directories exist in a fresh clone** — `input/`, `output/`, `work/` and
`library/` are all git-ignored. The engine creates the ones it writes to; the input root is the one
you have to make yourself, because only you know what goes in it:

```bash
mkdir -p input
cp -r /path/to/your/captures input/M31
```

No sample dataset ships with the project (astrophotography frames are hundreds of megabytes each).
Use your own — any folder of FITS, or a folder of DSLR raws, will do.

---

## 4. Start it

Two one-off commands, then two that stay running in their own terminals:

```bash
just setup      # once: Go deps, dev tools, the Siril MCP binary, frontend deps
just up         # starts Postgres in Docker (leave it running)

just dev        # terminal 1 — the API on :8080 (this is what drives Siril and GIMP)
just web        # terminal 2 — the web UI on :5173
```

`just dev` should print that it is listening on `:8080`. It applies database migrations itself on
boot, so there is no separate migrate step (`just migrate` exists and is harmless, just redundant).

Open <http://localhost:5173>. You should land on **Processing → Import**.

Every page has a **help** button next to its title that opens a short guided tour of that page. It
is worth two minutes on the Import page before continuing.

---

## 5. Your first run

### What a capture folder should look like

AstroStack works out what your files are rather than making you tell it. It reads, in order of
authority: the FITS headers, then file and folder names, then — if those say nothing — the pixels
themselves. Any of these layouts work:

```
input/M31/                          input/M31/                       input/rosette/
  Light_L_001.fits                    lights/                          DSC_0001.NEF
  Light_L_002.fits                    darks/                           DSC_0002.NEF
  Dark_001.fits                       flats/                           darks/
  Flat_L_001.fits                     bias/                              DSC_0100.NEF
```

- **Monochrome + filter wheel** — the filter must be discoverable: in the `FILTER` header, in the
  file name (`..._Ha_...`), or in a parent folder. If it is in none of them, AstroStack infers the
  filters from the signal and shows you its confidence so you can correct it.
- **Colour (one-shot colour)** — a Nikon/Canon/Sony raw, a colour camera's Bayer FITS, or plain
  colour TIFF/JPEG. Nothing to configure: it is detected during inspection and stacked as a single
  colour channel, and the Import page shows a **One-shot colour** badge so you can confirm.
- **Older captures with bare filenames** can carry a hand-written `info.txt` listing the capture
  order — see [calibration.md](calibration.md).

Calibration frames are optional. Without darks and flats the stack is noisier and keeps its dust
shadows, but it works.

### Launching

1. **Processing → Import**, browse to your folder, select it, press **Inspect**.
2. Read the inventory: frame counts per type, per-filter integration, and any warnings. If this
   looks wrong, everything downstream will be wrong — fix it here.
3. Pick a **preset** matching the subject (galaxy, star cluster, emission nebula, …) or just leave
   the defaults.
4. **Run pipeline.**

You are redirected to the job page, which streams progress: the current step, the CPU and memory of
whatever tool is running, a rolling log, and a preview after each milestone.

**It takes a while.** A few dozen frames is minutes; several hundred across multiple nights is
tens of minutes to hours. The live CPU figure is how you tell "working" from "stuck".

---

## 6. How to tell it worked

Results land in `output/<object>/<timestamp>/`:

```
output/M31/20260809_213000/
  final.xcf              layered GIMP composite (if GIMP is installed)
  final.tif  final.png   flattened results
  master_L.fits  …       the stacked master per channel
  run.json               everything about the run: parameters, per-frame stats, warnings
  previews/              the milestone previews the job page showed
```

`run.json` is the durable record — the **Runs** page re-renders any run from it, even after the
database is reset.

Read the **warnings** on the job page even when the image looks fine. They are where the honest bad
news lives: a channel that lost most of its frames to grading, calibration masters that did not
match, or colour calibration that could not run because the field would not plate-solve.

---

## 7. When it does not work

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `just dev` exits with "the API needs Postgres" | Postgres is not running | `just up` (and check Docker Desktop is started) |
| The UI loads but the first job fails immediately | Siril not found | `brew install --cask siril`, or set `SIRIL_BIN` in `.env`. The startup warning is on stderr, easy to miss under `just dev` |
| The file browser shows nothing | `ASTRO_DATA_DIR` points at a folder that does not exist, or has no captures | `mkdir -p input` and put a capture there |
| Colour frames vanish from the inventory | The folder holds monochrome AND colour lights | One run cannot stack both — split them into separate folders. The inventory warns about this |
| Plate-solving and colour calibration silently do nothing | The offline star catalogues are not downloaded | `just download-catalogues` (~3 GB; add `just download-catalogues-spcc` for photometric colour calibration, ~5 GB more). Without them these steps degrade quietly rather than failing |
| "port already in use" | Something else holds 5432, 8080, 5173 or 8082 | Override `POSTGRES_PORT`, `API_ADDR`, `WEB_PORT` or `WEB_PORT_PROD` in `.env`. `just stack` checks these three before building and names the variable to change |
| `just stack` says Docker is not running | Docker Desktop is installed but stopped | Start it and wait for the whale icon to settle, then re-run |
| `just stack` builds, then the engine never becomes healthy | Usually a migration or config error | It prints the last 40 log lines and exits; `just stack-logs` has the rest |
| A container run cannot reach your local AI model | `.env` pins `ASTRO_LLM_URL` to `127.0.0.1`, which inside a container means the container | Comment it out — the stack then uses `host.docker.internal`. The preflight warns about this |
| `just setup` fails at `golangci-lint` or `pnpm` | Not on macOS, or pnpm missing | Install both by hand; the rest of `just setup` is `go mod download` and `pnpm install` |
| A `just gitnexus-*` recipe fails | Those are author-only code-graph tools | Ignore them |
| Jobs die on large stacks | Too many concurrent workers for the RAM | Set `ASTRO_MAX_WORKERS=3` in `.env` |
